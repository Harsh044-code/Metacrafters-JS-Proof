# NFT Minting for Cricket Players

This project simulates the process of minting NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) for cricket players. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript objects and arrays to create and manage NFT metadata.

# Description
The main goal of this project is to create a system that allows you to mint NFTs representing cricket players. Each NFT contains metadata such as the player's name, country, batting style, bowling style, and jersey number.
